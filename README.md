# EnviroMine ~~for Galaxy Odyssey~~ continuation
### based on [EnviroMine for Galaxy Odyssey](https://gitgud.io/AstroTibs/enviromine-for-galaxy-odyssey) by [AstroTibs](https://gitgud.io/AstroTibs)



## Physics for blocks is disabled by default!
### To use it, go to: `Enviromine menu -> Custom editor -> Profile settings -> default_settings.cfg -> general -> Enable Physics -> true`,
### then go to: `Profile settings -> default_settings.cfg -> Config -> Generate Blank Configs` and `Generate Defaults -> true` (both)
### Please note, this is a very long process! may take up to 30 minutes of real time if you are using a large modpack

## Differences from the Galaxy Odyssey version:

### 1) more sanity debuffs (due to the fact that sanity in the original enviromine does almost nothing dangerous (+, from 1.3.134 version, if your sanity is less than or equal to 5 (but greater than 0) you will die from a heart attack after 1 minute, but if your sanity is 0, then you will die after 30 seconds, and, if more than 30 seconds have passed and your sanity has JUST dropped to 0, you will die instantly(configurable + you can disable death, but instead, some debuffs will become of a higher level))

### 2) Compatibility with Hbm's Nuclear Tech filters/masks/protective helmets

### 3) Updated build script, thanks to GTNH!

### 4) Fixed a bug where the sound of the gas mask was played even when the game was paused


## Current TODO:

- [x] implement death within a certain time when sanity = 0F

- [x] enviromine gas protection for  hbm filters/masks/protective helmets

- [x] custom / needed in the modpack things
